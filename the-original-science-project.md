# The Original SCIENCE Project

This was the inspiration for the creation of the Disciples of SCIENCE. In the evening of September 10th, 2016, <span>Grapes1023</span> and <span>VyrenGames</span> were riding far out to sea in a speedboat when it suddenly stopped moving and began to sink. <span>Vltor</span> flew out in a Luxor to "rescue" them, but his plane suddenly fell out of the sky. They had inadvertantly reached the boundary of the map. 

At that point, they wondered, "If we fly a Cargobob carrying something past that boundary, will they detatch or remain connected as they fall out of the sky?" So, while <span>Vltor</span> went to find a suitable vehicle, <span>VyrenGames</span> went to LSIA to get a Cargobob. 

We eventually decided on a Buccaneer, removed the roof, and fully pimped it out at Benny's. We then found a hooker and got her in the car with <span>Vltor</span>, while in the meantime <span>Grapes1023</span> had gotten in the Cargobob with me.
