# Put a Rhino Tank on a train

**Status:** <span class="status todo">To Do</span>

**Times Attempted:** 1

## Info
It's all in the title. Get a Rhino Tank and put it into a flatbed car on a train, just like we did with the Prison Bus. But this time it can shoot. 

## Report
Our first attempt was partially successful. <span>realsaladass</span> managed to get the Rhino onto the train, but he fell off because he hit the barrel on a pole by the sawmill. We also found that the Rhino is slightly too wide to fit comfortably inside the flatbed cars, so that is an issue we'll have to work around.
