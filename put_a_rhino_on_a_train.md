# Put a Rhino on a train

**Status:** To Do (Attempted)

**Times Attempted:** 1

**Completed By:** N/A

**Completion Date:** N/A


## Info
It's all in the title. Get a Rhino tank and put it into a flatbed car on a train, just like we did with the Prison Bus. But this time it can shoot. 

## Report
Our first attempt was partially successful. realsaladass managed to get the Rhino onto the train, but he fell off because he hit the barrel on a pole by the sawmill. We also found that the Rhino is slightly too wide to fit comfortably inside the flatbed cars, so that is an issue have to work around.
