## Info
Because that would be so much better than the Rhino Tank. With all that firepower we'd be unstoppable. Not really, but a battle-train in GTA V?! That sounds sweet! 

## Report
<span>Grapes1023</span> managed to land the Half-Track perfectly in one of the flatbed cars, but the APC was slightly too wide and fell off the train. <span>VyrenGames</span> and the gang chased the train all the way to the city trying to get the APC onto the train, but every time it got onto the flatbed it would just fall straight off the other side.
