## Info
Just a relaxing river cruise, devoid of any fire, explosions, and/or death... No, really. Trust me. 

## Report
GODDAMMIT!!! That blasted bridge got in the way! It wouldn't have been a problem if we were in a smaller boat, but the bridge was simply too low for the Tug to fit under. 

The river was also really shallow, and thus the Tug kept hitting the bottom and getting stuck.
