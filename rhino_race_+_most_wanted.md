# Rhino race + Most Wanted

**Status:** <span class="status success">Success</span>

**Completed By:** {{book.Vyren11}} (Tank Driver), {{book.cncman30}}, {{GRILT_CHEEZ}} (Tank Driver)

**Completion Date:** Friday, November 18, 2016


## Info
A group of people get Rhino tanks and head to the Vinewood Racetrack. Then we start Most Wanted from the "CEO Work" menu and have a "race" around the track. Whoever does the most laps in the ten minutes for Most Wanted wins the race. 

## Report
Brilliant success! We half expected the tanks to get destroyed immediately, but they actually took no visible damage during the ten minute run. All three of us survived the entire mission. 

The problem was that the tanks could ride up on the fence surrounding the track and get stuck. Normally we might ask another participant to help us get unstuck. However, because of Most Wanted we were all ghosted to one another and therefore unable to collide. 

The ghosting was useful as it prevented us from blowing each other up by accident. 

In the end, GRILT finished in first place, Vyren came in second, and cnc was last. 

We all agreed that it would have been better with a fourth member, but we were in an empty lobby at the time with no other friends online.
