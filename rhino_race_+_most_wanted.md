# Rhino race + Most Wanted

**Status:** <span class="status success">Success</span>

**Completed By:** <span>Vyren11</span> (Tank Driver), <span>cncman30</span> (Tank Driver), <span>GRILT_CHEEZ</span> (Tank Driver)

**Completion Date:** Friday, November 18, 2016


## Info
A group of people get Rhino tanks and head to the Vinewood Racetrack. Then we start Most Wanted from the CEO Work menu and have a "race" around the track. Whoever does the most laps in the ten minutes for Most Wanted wins the race. 

## Report
Brilliant success! We half expected the tanks to get destroyed immediately, but they ended up taking no visible damage during the ten-minute run. All three of us survived the entire mission. 

The problem was that the tanks could ride up on the fence surrounding the track and get stuck. Normally we might ask another participant to help us get unstuck, but because of Most Wanted we were all ghosted to one another and therefore unable to collide. The solution is simple: don't touch the fence. 

The ghosting was useful as it prevented us from blowing each other up by accident. 

In the end, <span>GRILT_CHEEZ</span> finished in first place, <span>Vyren11</span> came in second, and <span>cncman30</span> was last. 

We all agreed that it would have been better with a fourth member, but we were in an empty lobby at the time with no other friends online. 

This is definitely a repeatable activity as it is easy to set up and a lot of fun.
