## Info
Call a Bus from Pegasus and drive it up Mount Chiliad. Then drive it off the top and roll down the side. It'll be awesome, especially if the bus is full of people! 

## Report
It became obvious almost immediately that the Bus did not have the necessary horsepower or traction to make the climb alone. We tried using cars and an Insurgent to push the Bus up the mountain. It worked for a little while, but it was still unable to make it around some of the turns in the trail. 

We tried many different vehicles: a Bus, a Barracks, a Tour Bus, a Prison Bus, a Dump, etc., all without success. 

The "[Pick up a Bus with a Cargobob](/pick_up_a_bus_with_a_cargobob.md)" project was created partially because we wanted to see if we could skip the travel time up the mountain. The point of this project was to drive off the top of the mountain, not drive up it.
