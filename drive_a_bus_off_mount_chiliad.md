# Drive a Bus off Mount Chiliad

**Status:** <span class="status failure">Failure</span>

**Reason for Failure:** The Bus was unable to climb Mount Chiliad

**Times Attempted:** 3

**Attempted By:** <span>Vyren11</span> (Bus Driver), <span>cncman30</span> (Insurgent Driver), <span>Justinsgamez</span> (Car Driver)


## Info
Call a Bus from Pegasus and drive it up Mount Chiliad. Then drive it off the top and roll down the side. It'll be awesome, especially if the bus is full of people! 

## Report
It became obvious almost immediately that the Bus did not have the necessary horsepower or traction to make the climb alone. We tried using cars and an Insurgent to push the Bus
