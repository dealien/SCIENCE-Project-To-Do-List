# Pick up a person from the ocean with a helicopter

## Info
It would be so nice to be able to do this, but Rockstar seems to have missed thatfact when they created the game. Those annoying crate runs when the crates are on the Marquis would be so much better if you could actually pick up your people from the water instead of waiting until they made it back to shore. 

We need to find a somewhat foolproof way of doing this, and identify the correct vehicle for the job.
