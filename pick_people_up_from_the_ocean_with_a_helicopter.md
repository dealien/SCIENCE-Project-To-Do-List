# Pick people up from the ocean with a helicopter

**Status:** <span class="status attempted">Attempted</span>

**Reason for Failure:** The people were unable to get into the helicopter

## Info
It would be so nice to be able to do this, but Rockstar seems to have missed that fact when they created the game. Those annoying crate runs out to the Marquis in the middle of the ocean would be so much better if you could actually pick up your people from the water instead of waiting until they made it back to shore. 

We need to find a somewhat foolproof way of doing this, and identify the correct vehicle for the job.
