## Info
It would be so nice to be able to do this, but Rockstar seems to have missed that fact when they created the game. Those annoying crate runs out to the Marquis in the middle of the ocean would be so much better if you could actually pick up your people from the water instead of waiting until they made it back to shore. 

We need to find a somewhat foolproof way of doing this, and identify the correct vehicle for the job. 

## Report
### Attempt 1
We attempted to do this in a SuperVolito Carbon off the side of <span>cncman30</span>'s yacht, but it didn't work at all. We tried picking people up straight from the water, and also while they were standing on the wreckage of a Dinghy. 

Clearly different helicopters will work better than others because the Buzzard has been able to pick people up from water much more easily than that.
