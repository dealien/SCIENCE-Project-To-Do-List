## Info
There is a big orange ball on top of two different stalls in Los Santos; one is on the back of Vinewood Hills and the other is on the eastern edge of Sandy Shores (near the weed farm). I want to know if they float. I don't think they will, but they're surprisingly difficult to move so it will be a fun challenge either way.
