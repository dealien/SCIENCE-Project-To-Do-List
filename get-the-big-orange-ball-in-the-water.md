## Info
There is a big orange ball on top of two different stalls in Los Santos; one is on the back of Vinewood Hills and the other is on the eastern edge of Sandy Shores (near the weed farm). I want to know if they float. I don't think they will, but they're surprisingly difficult to move so it will be a fun challenge either way. 

## Report

The ball was really hard to move. All the collisions made our vehicles start to drive up the side of the ball, and sometimes the ball only existed for some people and not others. Eventually we managed to push it into the water (with the help of YourCaptainJim's Hydra's explosive cannon), but the ball sunk like a rock. 

It was slightly disappointing because the ball looks a lot like a giant inflatible beach ball, but oh well. It was fun anyway.
