The small, blue bus sometimes seen at or around the prison. It can be bought from Warstock Cache & Carry for $550,000 after completing The Prison Break (heist finale). It can seat 11 people. 

## Rhino

The only tank in GTA V. It can be bought from Warstock Cache & Carry for $1,500,000. It can seat 1 person.

## Benson

A delivery truck. It resembles those used by real-life companies such as Poland Springs. It often used in crate sale police busts to block off an alley or road. We have also found them during certain Motorcycle Club missions. 

The Benson cannot be purchased. According to the Grand Theft Auto wiki, the Benson randomly spawns in Alta, but we have yet to confirm this.
