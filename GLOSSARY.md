# Glossary

## Benson

A delivery truck. It resembles those used by real-life companies such as Poland Springs. It often used in crate sale police busts to block off an alley or road. We have also found them during certain Motorcycle Club missions. 

## Prison Bus

The small, blue bus sometimes seen at or around the prison. It can be bought from Warstock Cache & Carry for $550,000 after completing The Prison Break (heist finale). It can seat 11 people. 

## Rhino

The only tank in GTA V. It can be bought from Warstock Cache & Carry for $1,500,000. It can seat 1 person. 

## Titan

A massive military cargo plane. 

## Tug

The massive tug boat used in some CEO deliveries. It's the largest boat in the game. It doesn't really have a maximum capacity because there are no actual seats, but people don't fall off of it so you can stand pretty much anywhere. 

It's extremely slow, and because it's a Pegasus vehicle you can't upgrade it.
