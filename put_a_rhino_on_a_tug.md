# Put a Rhino on a Tug
**Status:** Failed

**Reason for Failure:** The Rhino is far too heavy for the Tug

**Attempted By:** {{ Vyren11 }} (Boat Driver), {{ DuckterZoidberg }} (, {{ cncman30 }}, {{ TheNousKid }}, {{ realsaladass }}


## Info
Because wouldn't it be cool to just cruise around with a massive turreted boat? I thought so. 

## Report
We brought a Tug, a Rhino tank and a Cargobob to the south side of the Alamo Sea near Sandy Shores. We sailed the Tug about halfway across the lake, then used the Cargobob to carry the Rhino tank to the Tug. 

We made sure that we didn't drop the Rhino onto the boat by touching down gently before releasing it. Even so, as soon as the Rhino landed on the Tug, they both just dropped like a stone to the bottom of the lake. 

There was nobody in the Rhino and one person on the Tug. It was the weight of the Rhino alone that brought the Tug down.
