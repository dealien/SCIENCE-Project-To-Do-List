## Info
Even though you can't actually control the train, it doesn't mean we won't try. According to Glitch Master <span>DuckterZoidberg</span>, if you eat snacks in just the right spot on the front platform of the train you can glitch inside. 

## Report
We have no idea how it happened really. All we know is that you stand on top of the very front of the train, directly in front of the top front windows of the cabin. Then you wait for the lag to  glitch you into the train.
