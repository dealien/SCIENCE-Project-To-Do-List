## Info
So you've stolen many Fire Trucks and used them to wash your cars for free, role play as firefighters, and generally troll your friends (and your enemies too). But have you ever wondered the extent of the Fire Trucks' godly power? Well now it's time to find out! 

Things to try: 
* Put out rockets in midair or when they impact an object to minimize or prevent damage
* Keep a damaged Rhino Tank (or other vehicle) from blowing up when heavily damaged by spraying the fire
* Put out a Molotov Cocktail in midair
* Find out what happens when you spray someone while they're parachuting
