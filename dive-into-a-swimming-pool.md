**Status:** <span class="status failure">Failure</span>

**Reason for Failure:** The pools did not negate fall damage

## Info
Just dive into a swimming pool...from a helicopter. Sounds easy enough, right? No, no it doesn't. But that's why we're doing it! 

Apparently you take fall damage when you fall into water, but it is negated if you fall into a pool. 

## Report
That was a colossal failure. The swimming pools made REALLY tiny targets, and we couldn't just drop straight down. We would always drift forwards slightly, which was really annoying. 

The worst part was that after all that falling and dying, when we finally landed in the pool we still took fall damage. How do people do it without dying? 

This requires further investigation, but we can save that for a later date.
