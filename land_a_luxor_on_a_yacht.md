**Completion Date:** N/A

## Idea
Land a Luxor jet on a yacht. 

## Report
<span>Vltor92</span> successfully landed the plane (after several tries) on the back of <span>Vyren11</span>'s Galaxy yacht. He landed on the helipad where the SuperVolito Carbon spawns. The plane was flyable afterwards, but there wasn't enough room on the yacht to take off so the plane crashed into the sea.
