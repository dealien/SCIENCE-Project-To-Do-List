# Put motorcycles in the back of a Benson

**Status:** To Do

**Completed By:** N\/A

**Completion Date:** N\/A

## Idea

We have Pegasus bring us a Prison Bus and then we drive it off of a bridge and into the flatbed of a train.

## Report

Our first attempts to put a bike in a truck failed because we were using regular 18-wheelers. After a quick investigation online, we found that the Benson would be the best truck to use. But finding one is the problem. I read that they are sometimes found near the Burton Los Santos Customs, but they're apparently very rare.

After approximately 2.5 hours of searching, we failed to locate a Benson. theye must be far ore rare than we originally thought, if they even sawn naturally at all.
