## Idea
We find a Benson delivery truck somewhere, open the back, and use it to carry bikes and stuff around. It'll be awesome!

## Report

### Attempt 1
Our first attempts to put a bike in a truck failed because we were using regular 18-wheelers. After a quick investigation online, we found that the Benson would be the best truck to use. However, finding one is a problem. I read that they are sometimes found near the Burton Los Santos Customs, but they're apparently very rare.

After approximately 2.5 hours of searching, we failed to locate a Benson. They must be far more rare than we originally thought, if they even spawn naturally at all. They do spawn during certain crate missions, such as police busts, and MC jobs, such as deliveries.

### Attempt 2
When we finally did get a Benson we were unable to open the back door. We tried the old stomp-on-the-roof-above-the-back-door tactic, the shoot-the-back-door-with-an-MG tactic, and the accidentally-blow-up-the-entire-truck-while-trying-to-blow-the-back-door-open tactic, all without success. I don't know whether or not we were doing it wrong, but Rockstar might have removed the ability to open truck doors when they removed the Titan's ability to carry cargo. 

There has to be a way to open the back. The MC bike delivery missions sometimes require you to drive the bikes into the back of a Benson, but how do you get the Benson open in the first place? There must be a way—its just a matter of us figuring it out.

### Attempt 3
We tested a Mule truck that spawned during one of our standard CEO crate runs when the crates had been stolen—the one with its doors open. We had <span>cncman30</span> stand in the back of the truck while we drove it around to see if he would fall out, but he managed to remain standing the entire time. 

This proves that it is indeed possible to use a truck the way in which we want. We just need to find a way to make a truck's doors open, or find a truck with its doors open somewhere that we can use.
