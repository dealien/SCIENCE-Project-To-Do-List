## Idea

We find a Benson delivery truck somewhere, open the back, and use it to carry bikes and stuff around. It'll be awesome!

## Report

Our first attempts to put a bike in a truck failed because we were using regular 18-wheelers. After a quick investigation online, we found that the Benson would be the best truck to use. But finding one is the problem. I read that they are sometimes found near the Burton Los Santos Customs, but they're apparently very rare.

After approximately 2.5 hours of searching, we failed to locate a Benson. They must be far more rare than we originally thought, if they even spawn naturally at all. They do spawn during certain crate missions, such as police busts, and MC jobs, such as deliveries.

When we finally did find a Benson we were unable to open the back door. We tried the old stomp-on-the-roof-above-the-back-door tactic, the shoot-the-back-door-with-an-MG tactic, and the accidentally-blow-up-the-entire-truck-while-trying-to-blow-the-back-door-open tactic, all without success. I don't know if we were doing it wrong, but Rockstar might have removed that capability when they removed the Titan's ability to carry cargo. 

There has to be a way to open the back. The MC bike delivery missions sometimes require you to drive the bikes into the back of a Benson, but how do you get the Benson open in the first place? There must be a way--its just a matter of us being able to find it.
