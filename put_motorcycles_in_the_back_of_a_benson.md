# Put motorcycles in the back of a Benson

**Status:** To-Do

**Completed By:** N/A

**Completion Date:** N/A

## Idea
We have Pegasus bring us a Prison Bus and then we drive it off of a bridge and into the flatbed of a train. 

## Report
Our first attempts to put a bike in a truck failed because we were using regular 18-wheelers. After a quick investigation online, we found that the Benson would be the best truck to use.
