# Put a Prison Bus on a train

**Status:** Success

**Completed By:** <span>Vyren11</span>, <span>cncman30</span>, <span>DuckterZoidberg</span>, <span>TheNousKid</span>, <span>realsaladass</span>

## Idea
We have Pegasus bring us a Prison Bus and then we drive it off of a bridge and into the flatbed of a train. cnc and Zoidberg drove down the tracks to make a train come. Then they got on it and rode back to me, allowing me to see the location of the train. 

## Report
It went way better than expected. The Prison Bus landed almost perfectly in the flatbed. It was hard to know when to drive off, but my timing was miraculously perfect.
