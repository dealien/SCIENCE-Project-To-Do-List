# Put a Prison Bus on a train

**Status:** Success

**Completed By:** {{book.Vyren11}}, {{book.cncman30}}, {{book.DuckterZoidberg}}, {{book.TheNousKid}}, {{book.realsaladass}}

## Idea
We have Pegasus bring us a Prison Bus and then we drive it off of a bridge and into the flatbed of a train. Once the bus is in place we have {{book.cncman30}} and {{book.DuckterZoidberg}} drive down the tracks to make a train come. Then they get on the train and ride back to me, allowing me to see the progress of the train. 

## Report
It went way better than expected. The Prison Bus landed almost perfectly in the flatbed. It was hard to know when to drive off, but my timing was miraculously perfect. 

In the future we need to have the train-catchers ride in the first flatbed car. That would allow the person attempting to board the train to see where they need to aim to land in the flatbed.
