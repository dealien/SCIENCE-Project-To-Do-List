# Put a Prison Bus on a train

**Status:** <span class="status success">Success</span>

**Completed By:** {{book.Vyren11}}, {{book.cncman30}}, {{book.DuckterZoidberg}}, {{book.TheNousKid}}, {{book.realsaladass}}

## Idea
We have Pegasus bring us a Prison Bus and then we drive it off of a bridge and into the flatbed of a train. 

## Report
Once the bus is in place we had {{book.cncman30}} and {{book.DuckterZoidberg}} drive their cars down the tracks to make a train come. Then they got on the train and rode back to me, allowing me to see the progress of the train. 

It went way better than expected. The Prison Bus landed almost perfectly in the flatbed. It was hard to know when to drive off, but my timing was miraculously perfect. 

{{book.TheNousKid}} tried to drive his car onto the train as well, but he didn't get to the top of the tunnel in time. 

In the future we need to have the train-catchers ride in the first flatbed car. That would allow the person attempting to board the train to see where they need to aim to land in the flatbed.
