# Pick up a Bus with a Cargobob

**Status:** To Do

**Completed By:** N/A

**Completion Date:** N/A


## Info
We can pick up many things with a Cargobob (except an Insurgent), but can we pick up something as large as a Bus? If we can't lift a regular Bus, maybe we can lift a Prison Bus. I feel like this would be another great, unique form of transportation.
