# Pick up a Bus with a Cargobob

## Info
We can pick up many things with a Cargobob (except an Insurgent), but can we pick up something as large as a Bus? If we can't lift a regular Bus, maybe we can lift a Prison Bus. I feel like this would be another great, unique form of transportation. 

## Report
We managed to hook the Bus with the Cargobob and lift it a few feet off the ground, but it was too heavy to carry over long distances. Using both a Bus and a Cargobob is an unfeasible mode of travel, even though it would allow you to carry almost everyone in a full server—16 people on the Bus, and 10 people in the Cargobob, leaving behind 4 of the maximum 30 people on a server.
