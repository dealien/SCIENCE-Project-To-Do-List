This is a list of all the SCIENCE projects undertaken by the [Disciples of SCIENCE](https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/disciples_of_science) crew in Grand Theft Auto: Online. It is written and updated by none other than their leader, <span>Vyren11</span>. 

Don't ask why it says "FAQ" everywhere. It just does and there's nothing I can do. Deal with it. 

Also, for some reason when you click on an image the first time it doesn't always take you to the correct page. If that happens, just click on the image again.
