Also, for some reason when you click on an image the first time it doesn't always take you to the correct page. If that happens, just click on the image again.

Everyone is welcome on our official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4GHBDpf). If you are interested in joining the crew, just ask one of the leaders on Discord for an invite. [VyrenGames](https://www.twitch.tv/vyrengames) will most likely be live streaming crew activities as well, so keep an eye out for those.
