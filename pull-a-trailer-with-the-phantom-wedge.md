## Info
The new truck is so much better than the other trucks. It's faster, stronger, and it's got a massive car plow on the front. If we could use that thing during Haulage missions and such, it would be so much better. 

## Report
It actually worked! It was so much faster than using the regular truck for Haulage missions. Of course, it was also able to push cars out of the way with the massive plow on the front.

Somehow, <span>VyrenGames</span> somehow managed to blow up the cab with C4, but besides that it worked perfectly.
